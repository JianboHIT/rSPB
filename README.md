___Restructure single parabolic band(**RSPB**) model for quick analysis in thermoelectricity___

'SPB Calculation And Plot.xltx' is an efficient tool to implement SPB analysis. The Seebeck coefficient, 
carrier consideration and mobility (or electrical conductivity) are required as inputs. Effective mass 
___m*___, intrinsic carrier mobility ___μ___<sub>0</sub>, 
weighted carrier mobility ___μ___<sub>w</sub>, optimal carrier concentration ___n___<sub>opt</sub> and 
corresponding maximum power factor ___PF___<sub>opt</sub> can be 
evaluated under SPB framework.(**Ref**: J. Zhu, X. Zhang, M. Guo, _et al_. Restructured single parabolic band model for quick analysis in thermoelectricity, _Npj Computational Materials_, 2021, **7**:116. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-021-00587-5)

Beyond the parabolic band approximation, realistic band structures universally exhibit varying degrees 
of deviation from the ideal behavior. Such nonparabolicity can introduce significant systematic deviations 
in determining the Lorenz number from experimental Seebeck coefficients. Here, a robust correction 
scheme incorporating the band non-parabolicity factor (___ξ___) is developed to address these limitations.
